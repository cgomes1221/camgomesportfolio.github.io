                        <div class="content">
                            Hello, my name is Cameron Gomes. I am a recent graduate of Curry College with a major in Information Technology and a minor in Cybersecurity. <br> <br>
                            While in school I also took time to learn about personal finance and the stock market. I gained a large interest in these fields which eventually led me to
                            learning about stock options trading. Trading stocks options became another source of income for me throughout college.<br><br>
                             Upon graduation I took some time to think about where
                            I was from a financial standpoint and realized that I was in a very good spot. I have always enjoyed being creative and turning some of my ideas into products.
                            I have always wanted to create my own mobile application and decided that after graduaiton was the perfect time for me to start.
                            The application, Crosshair Sports, is now complete and available to download from the AppStore. <br><br>
                            While working on the application, I have gained experience working with Adobe's Adobe XD design tool as well as Google's Flutter development kit and Firebase software. <br><br>
                           
                            The process of creating my own applicatiaon has given me confidence in myself and my abilities. I feel like that there's is no reason why I could not learn how to use any tool or software.
                            Creating this application has helped me develop technical skills but also grow as a person. 
                            <br><br>
                            Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio and look at some of my work. Hope you enjoy!

                                    <p class="mb-2">Crosshair Sports is a free to use mobile application created to help athletes promote themselves and get noticed by coaches. Many sports recruiting services have become expensive 
                                        and hard to obtain for many families. With sports becoming more comopetitive than ever before, it is important for athletes to be able to receive the exposure needed in order to be seen by coaches
                                        at the next level. Some features of this application include: the ability to post pictures and videos,
                                        direct messaging that allows players and coaches to communicate with each other, a news feed that allows athletes and coaches to share important announcements with one another, and the ability to search for users. 
                                        This application is now available to download on the AppStore.

                                    <p class="mb-2">Steelo is a UI mobile application that combines aspects of dating apps such as Tinder, with ecommerce applications such as Poshmark. 
                                    The first screen shown to users allows them to swipe right or left on clothing that they may or may not be interseted in buying. 
                                    Swiping right would add the product to the users cart while swiping left would show that they do not have interest in the product.
                                    Other available pages include an explore page, that shows popular styles that other users are wearing and a page that shows the user's closet which would show items that the user would want to sell to others. This application was created with Dart and Flutter.</p>

                                        goal of this mobile app was to put as many features from the Gold Standard Basketball Training website into a mobile application. Features of this app include: a feed of blog posts 
                                    from Coach Girodano, detailed pages on services offred by the company, detailed pages on all coaches and trainers involved with the business, the ability to sign up for 
                                appointments, tracking user's progress, and videos of workouts that users can follow along. This mobile application was created using Dart and Flutter. </p>
